Game of Life Rules
==================

The simulation starts with an initial pattern of cells on the grid and computes successive
generations of cells according to the following rules:

1. A location that has zero or one neighbor will be empty in the next generation. If a cell was in
that location, it dies of loneliness.

2. A location with two neighbors is stable—that is, if it contained a cell, it still contains a cell. If
it was empty, it's still empty.

3. A location with three neighbors will contain a cell in the next generation. If it was unoccupied
before, a new cell is born. If it currently contains a cell, the cell remains. Good times.

4. A location with four or more neighbors will be empty in the next generation. If there was a
cell in that location, it dies of overcrowding.

5. The births and deaths that transform one generation to the next must all take effect
simultaneously. Thus, when computing a new generation, new births and deaths in that
generation don’t impact other births and deaths in that generation. To keep the two
generations separate, you will need to work on two versions of 3 the grid—one for the current
generation, and a second that allows you to compute and store the next generation without
changing the current one.
